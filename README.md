# EntityEngine
A game engine I am currently developing utilizing an Entity Framework and SharpDX

### End-goal:
  Develop map format, and editor for said map. Game defaults to load mainmenu.map. Mainmenu.map has code that allows loading of other maps, and is generally the 'jumpstart' of the program. Think of this like an operating system for games.

### How do I get there? [ie implementation]:
  Custom Entity Framework;  
  SharpDX - DirectX10  
  IronPython  
  C#  
  Python  
  [Eventually a physics engine]

### TO-DO:
  Physics engine/System  
  AI engine/System  
  Position System needs move/rotate/scale commands  
  Camera class needs same commands  
  Input Map System needs implemented  
  Script System needs implemented  
  Map layout/generation/loading System needs implemented  
  Player System needs implemented  
  Generic shaders need written  
  Map editor needs made
